\chapter {Results}
\label{chap:results}

This chapter provides the learning parameters, graphical representations of the training progresses and results of the test runs performed using the 3- and 4-class datasets on a number of networks based on the original U-Net, each with slight variations like different weight weight initializations. Each variation's results are compared with the results of the network preceding it in order to find a network that achieves the best possible results on the test data. Finally, the results of the best network are compared with results achieved by the image segmentation methods described in Chapter \textbf{\ref{chap:concepts}} which are not based on neural networks.

	\section{Hardware}
All variants of the U-Net were trained on a NVIDIA TITAN X GPU (12 GB GDDR5X RAM) using Caffe's CUDA/cuDNN support. \textbf{TODO: Processor, RAM? What else?}

	\section {Segmentation quality evaluation}

\noindent As there are many possible variations of the U-Net architecture, these variations were tested iteratively, choosing the best network of a number of networks and modifying it further. This was done because an exhaustive search for the best combination of weight initialization, activation functions, hyperparameters like the learning rate and techniques such as Dropout and Batch Normalization would have exceeded the time limit of this thesis. Also, at the time of writing, it was not yet known how these different approaches interact precisely. For example, Batch Normalization and specialized weight initialization schemes have the same goal but achieve it in different ways, making it unclear whether one or the other performs better in practice.\\

\noindent To compare the performance of all methods on the validation set with each other, the \textit{Micro} and \textit{Macro} variants of the F-Measure \cite{micromacro} are a suitable way to quantify how well the segmentation works. The Micro F-Measure is defined by the Precision and Recall quantities (see Section \textbf{\ref{subsec:fmeasure}}) of the validation set:

\[ F_{1\mu} = 2 \left ( \frac{\text{PR}_\mu \cdot \text{RC}_\mu}{\text{PR}_\mu + \text{RC}_\mu} \right ) \]

\noindent Here, $\text{PR}_\mu$ and $\text{RC}_\mu$ denote the micro-average Precision and Recall over the entire validation set. $\text{PR}_\mu$ and $\text{RC}_\mu$ are calculated by taking the sum of all TP, FP and FN values for all images and deriving the Precision and Recall over all $n$ validation images from these sums, i.e.

\[ \text{PR}_\mu = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\text{TP}_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (\text{TP}_i + \text{FP}_i)} \text{ and }  \text{RC}_\mu = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{TP}_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (\text{TP}_i + \text{FN}_i)} \]

\noindent The Macro F-Measure likewise is defined as

\[ F_{\text{1M}} = 2 \left ( \frac{\text{PR}_\text{M} \cdot \text{RC}_\text{M}}{\text{PR}_\text{M} + \text{RC}_\text{M}} \right ) \]

\noindent where $\text{PR}_\text{M}$ and $\text{RC}_\text{M}$ are the macro-average Precision and Recall. These are calculated for each sample independently, summed, and averaged over all $n$ samples:

\[ \text{PR}_\text{M} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{\text{TP}_i}{\text{TP}_i + \text{FP}_i} \text { and } \text{RC}_\text{M} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{\text{TP}_i}{\text{TP}_i + \text{FN}_i} \] 

\noindent \cite[pp. 317-318]{information_retrieval} highlights that the Micro F-Measure is dominated by ``large'' classes, meaning classes that occur often in the ground truth data. This would shift the focus of the evaluation of the segmentation effectiveness towards whether the primarily large classes are segmented correctly. As most pixels in the validation images are background pixels and the correct segmentation of the non-background class pixels is of more interest, the Macro F-Measure is therefore chosen for assessing which method performs best because it is biased towards smaller classes rather than large ones, but for completeness, both scores are listed.\\

\noindent The first test run pitted two nearly identical U-Net networks against each other, using ReLU activations and Dropout with $p = 0.5$. The only difference was the choice of the loss function. The \textbf{W} networks used the weighted Cross-Entropy Loss, while the \textbf{F1} networks employed the multi-class F-Measure. Both networks were trained for 80,000 iterations (or $\approx$ 32 epochs) on both the 3-class and the 4-class training set (indicated by an additional $\_3$ or $\_4$ suffix in the network name), while testing the network on the respective validation set every 1,000 iterations.

The \textbf{W} network used an initial learning rate of 0.001, a step learning rate decay of a factor $\zeta = 0.1$ every 20,000 iterations and a momentum modifier $\gamma = 0.99$, while the \textbf{F1} network used an initial learning rate of 0.0001, $\zeta = 0.3$ every 20,000 iterations and $\gamma = 0.99$. Both networks used $\text{L}^2$ gradient regularization and a mini-batch size of 5.

The progress of the training is shown in Figure \textbf{\ref{fig:weighted_f1_training}}.\\

\noindent The results of testing the networks on the validation set are shown in Table \textbf{\ref{tab:results1}}. They indicate that both networks perform similarly well, converging at about 25 epochs, although using a Cross-Entropy loss function beats the F-Measure by a slight margin. Reducing the dataset to three classes by merging the red and blue classes improves the results for both networks regardless of the loss function. The Cross-Entropy networks achieved overall Macro F-Measure scores of $\approx$0.877 for 3 classes and $\approx$0.746 for 4 classes. Based on these results, for the following tests, Cross-Entropy was used as the loss function as it yielded better results.\\

\label{tab:results1}
\end {table}

\noindent The second training case tested whether using Batch Normalization provides benefits, either in convergence speed or validation score. Therefore, the \textbf{W} networks were modified to perform Batch Normalization before each ReLU activation, implemented in Caffe as a ``Batch Normalization'' layer that normalizes its input according to the mini-batch statistics, followed by a ``Scale'' layer that applies the affine transformation. Also, all Dropout layers were removed, as advised in \cite{batchnorm}. These networks receive an additional \textbf{\_BN} as part of their name.

Again, the network was trained on the 3- and 4-class datasets, this time, considering the notes on accelerating a network with Batch Normalization in \cite{batchnorm}, with a higher initial learning rate of 0.005, and a faster step learning rate decay that reduces the learning rate by $\zeta = 0.1$ every 7,500 iterations. Momentum was kept at $\gamma = 0.99$. However, the network parameters didn't fit into memory with a mini-batch size of 5 because of the added Batch Normalization layers, and therefore the mini-batch size had to be lowered to 2. To be able to still compare the training to previous results, the number of iterations was raised to 200,000 so that the network was trained for $\approx$32 epochs as before.

The training progress is shown in Figure \textbf{\ref{fig:weighted_weighted_batchnorm_training}}. As expected, the networks converge much faster when using Batch Normalization, taking only about 5 epochs of training until convergence, which is a five-fold reduction of the needed training time.\\

\end {figure}

\noindent From the test results, shown in Table \textbf{\ref{tab:results2}}, it is evident that the networks with Batch Normalization were better consistently for the 4-class dataset, achieving an overall Macro F-Measure score of $\approx$0.776, which is an improvement on the previous score of $\approx$0.746. For the easier 3-class dataset however, the overall Macro F-Measure score was $\approx$0.871 which is slightly worse than the result of the network without Batch Normalization, achieving a score of $\approx$0.877. Despite this, it was still deemed advisable to use Batch Normalization from hereafter to reduce the training time of the networks, as the difference in the error might as well be noise resulting from the random initialization of the network.\\

In the next round of tests, the effect of shuffling on the training of weighted Cross-Entropy Loss networks with Batch Normalization was evaluated, using the same training parameters as before - especially the same number of epochs because shuffling was expected to either reduce the number of epochs necessary for convergence via speeding up the learning process, so that after the shuffling tests, or alternatively make the network take longer to converge, but gaining additional validation accuracy in return. Depending on the results, the epoch number can then be reduced to whichever number is necessary, which should provide a large training speedup in comparison to the prior number of epochs in either case. The networks with enabled shuffling have an additional \textbf{\_S} as part of their name. The training progress is shown in Figure \textbf{\ref{fig:weighted_batchnorm_shuffle_training}}.

\noindent As the next evaluation step, the effect of the weight initialization on \textbf{W\_BN\_S} was compared, using the Xavier and the MSRA initializations. It was believed that MSRA should work better for all networks using ReLU activations or its variations. The networks up to this point used the Xavier initialization, so the networks with MSRA initialization received an additional \textbf{\_MS} tag. The number of epochs was reduced to $\approx$6. The training progress is shown in Figure \textbf{\ref{fig:weighted_batchnorm_shuffle_msra_training}}.\\

Finally, the choice of the activation function used throughout the network was evaluated.

\noindent Because Otsu thresholding, K-Means and Gaussian Mixture Models are all unsupervised methods, i.e. they do not depend on ground truth images, the labels they output have no direct relation to the ground truth labels used in the CNN training. Therefore, all combinations of matching the output labels with the ground truth labels are evaluated and for each, a multi-class F-Measure score is calculated. The assignment with the highest score is assumed to be the correct one, which is then used for comparing the performance of the unsupervised methods to the CNN performance.\\
