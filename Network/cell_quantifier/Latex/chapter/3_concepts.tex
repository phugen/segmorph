\chapter{Basic Concepts}

This section explains an array of concepts that can be used to segment an image into multiple areas. In the ``Results'' chapter (\ref{ch:results}), the performance of all the mentioned algorithms is compared, using the same data set each time.
	
	\section{Thresholding}
\textbf{TODO: Mehr Ã¼ber Otsu, FIGURE}\\
\label{sec:thresholding}

Thresholding is the simplest segmentation algorithm there is: Given an input image with dimensions $x \times y$ and intensity values $z$ (for instance, $[0, 255]$ at 8-bit color depth), defined as a function 

\[I(x, y) \to z, \text{ for } x, y, z \in \mathbb{N}_0,\]

\noindent the thresholding function is defined as follows:

\[ T(I(x, y), \theta) =  \begin{cases}
				1 \text{ if } I(x, y) \, \geq \, \theta \\
			           0 \text{ otherwise}
			     \end{cases}
\]


\noindent This yields a binary segmentation of the image into two classes, given that $\theta$ is chosen properly. The choice of $\theta$ is therefore crucial for the success of the segmentation. One way to find a suitable threshold parameter is (automated) image histogram analysis, such as in Otsu's method.\cite{Otsu}

Otsu's method iterates through all possible values for $\theta$ and calculates the ``between-class variance'' ${\sigma^{2}}_B$ for each $\theta$, defined as

\[ {\sigma^2}_{B} = W_b W_f (\mu_b - \mu_f)^2,\]

\noindent where $W_b$ and $W_f$ are the weights - the sum of pixels in all bins belonging to either the background or foreground class, as determined by $\theta$, divided by the total number of pixels - and $\mu_b$ and $\mu_f$ are the statistical mean values for the background and foreground classes. The threshold with the maximum \textbf{between}-class variance corresponds to a segmentation in which the pixels of each class have minimum \textbf{within}-class variance: Intuitively, this means that the pixels of each class are very much alike.

However, this approach doesn't work as well for images whose histograms are not bimodal at all - for example, due to excessive noise - and also, while possible, doesn't perform well for cases in which a large number of classes is to be segmented.\\

\noindent This thresholding mechanism is called ``global thresholding'' because the same threshold is applied to the entire image. However, there are also local thresholding algorithms which segment different parts of the image with different thresholds. The need for such algorithms often arises when the illumination of the input image is irregular, for example when cast shadows overlay part of the image (see \ref{fig:illumination}). One approach is to calculate a threshold for each pixel of the image while examining a neighborhood of size $L \times L$ around the pixel in question, using the mean, the mean of the maximum and minimum values or the median of the resulting local pixel intensity distribution to determine a local threshold.

Local thresholding, however, also depends on choosing $L$ so that the local neighborhoods contain enough pixels of either class, or otherwise the local thresholds won't be chosen well\cite[pp.~84--93]{machine_vision}.


	\section{K-Means}
K-Means \cite{kmeans} is a general-purpose data clustering algorithm whose aim is to create $k$ data clusters from all $n$-dimensional data points $d = (f_1, f_2, \dots, f_n)$ so that the squared distance from each data point in the cluster to the cluster mean is minimized overall. Mathematically, this means calculating

\[ \argmin \limits_{C} \sum \limits_{i=1}^{k} \sum \limits_{d \in C_i} || d - \mu_i||^2 ,\]

\noindent where $C_{i \dots k}$ are the $k$ clusters and $\mu_{i \dots k}$ is the mean of the respective cluster. Viewed graphically, this is equal to computing a higher-order Voronoi diagram for the data, using the $k$ cluster centroids as the Voronoi cell centers (see Figure \ref{fig:kmeans}).

The algorithm is initialized with $k$ either random or differently selected cluster centers. Then, the algorithm executes the two steps described in \ref{alg:kmeans_pseudo} alternatingly until either a set number of iterations is reached or the overall difference between the current and the last centroid positions falls below a threshold $\epsilon$.

\begin {algorithm}
	\caption{K-Means ($\epsilon$, iter\_max)}\label{alg:kmeans_pseudo}
	\begin {algorithmic}[1]
		\State iter = 0
		\State Assign each data point to exactly one of the $k$ clusters by selecting the cluster that has the closest mean distance as defined above.
		\State Calculate new cluster centers by recalculating the mean of all elements assigned to each cluster and calculate difference $\Delta$ compared to previous iteration.
		\If {$\Delta < \epsilon$ \textbf{or} iter == iter\_max}
			\State \textbf{end}
		\Else
			\State iter += 1
			\State \textbf{goto} step 2
		\EndIf
	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\begin {figure}[!ht]
	\includegraphics{img/fig_kmeans}
	\caption{Application of the K-Means algorithm to a test image. \textbf{Top left}: Input image. \textbf{Top right}: Ground truth labels of the input image. \textbf{Bottom left}: K-means results with $k=4$,  using arbitrary colors for the labels. \textbf{Bottom right}: Results with $k=6$. It is noteworthy that while the results for $k=4$ are reasonable, the nearly transparent lamellopodium pixels are labelled as background values, while the cell proper is segmented into two parts.}
	\label{fig:kmeans}
\end {figure}

\noindent Obviously, this algorithm can also be used to segment images into $k$ different classes, but since K-Means assigns classes to data by using the distance from the mean, the algorithm output favors segmentations in which the classes have roughly the same size, which isn't necessarily the correct way to classify pixels in arbitrary image data.

	\section{Canny Edge Detection}
\label{sec:canny}
The \textit{Canny Edge Detector} \cite{canny} is one of the most famous edge-detection algorithms and actually is a composite algorithm that returns a binary segmentation of an image into edges and non-edges.\\

\noindent First, a Gaussian convolution filter is applied to try and subdue noise in the image. A \textit{convolution} is a matrix operation often used in image processing: A matrix $A$, describing the pixel values of an image, is convolved pixel-wise with a convolution matrix $B$ with dimensions $n \times n$ - that is, for each pixel $p$ of $A$, the pixel's $n \times n$-neighborhood pixel values are summed up while being weighted according to corresponding value in $B$. The resulting sum is then assigned to the output matrix in place of the previous value of the center pixel, which intuitively assumes the distance-weighted average value of its neighborhood. In the case of pixels that lie on the edge of the matrix to be convoluted, out-of-bounds considerations have to be made: A constant value such as zero can be assumed for the pixels in the neighborhood that would lie ``outside'' of the image, the existing image values can be mirrored or clamped to provide a torus-like out-of-bounds handling, or the convolution can be done only on those pixels whose neighborhood fully lies inside of the image, resulting in smaller output images.

The aforementioned ``Gaussian filter'' or ``kernel'' is a matrix whose values are defined so that performing a convolution using that matrix approximates the behavior of the two-dimensional Gaussian function with uniform variances for its $x$- and $y$-dimensions:

\[ f(x, y) = \exp \left(- \left( \frac{\left(x - p_x \right)^2}{2\sigma^2} + \frac{ \left(y - p_y \right)^2}{2\sigma^2} \right) \right), \]

\noindent where $p$ is the center pixel of the current neighborhood. Subsequently, $p_x$ and $p_y$ are the coordinates of this pixel within the matrix and $\sigma$, the standard variance, acts as the smoothing constant. The higher this constant is, the stronger the blur effect becomes.

In Gaussian filters, the $\sigma$ constant is expressed through the dimensions of the matrix - the larger the filter matrix, the stronger the blur effect. An example for a $3 \times 3$ Gaussian filter is the following matrix:

\[ \frac{1}{16} \left [ \begin{tabular}{ccc}
				1& 2& 1\\
				2& 4& 2\\
				1& 2& 1 
			   \end{tabular} \right ]\]

\noindent The coefficient $\frac{1}{16}$ is equal to the sum of the matrix values and ensures that the convolution does not change the average image value. \cite[p. 41]{machine_vision}\\

\noindent As the second step, an gradient-based edge detector filter is applied to the smoothed image. The most famous of these is the \textit{Sobel filter} \cite{sobel}, which approximates the local partial derivatives $\frac{\partial I}{\partial x}$ and $\frac{\partial I}{\partial y}$ of each pixel of the image function $I(x, y)$, using the $3 \times 3$ neighborhood of that pixel. It is given by the following matrices\cite[pp. 113 -- 114]{machine_vision}:

\[ \text{Sobel}_x = \left [ \begin{tabular}{ccc}
				-1& 0& 1\\
				-2& 0& 2\\
				-1& 0& 1 
			   \end{tabular} \right ] \text{ and } 
\text{Sobel}_y = \left [ \begin{tabular}{ccc}
				1& 2& 1\\
				0& 0& 0\\
				-1& -2& 1 
			   \end{tabular} \right ] 
\]

\noindent The result of these convolutions are two images, $G_x$ and $G_y$, which represent the partial local derivatives of each pixel. The gradient image of the original input image $I$ is then defined as

\[G = |\nabla I| = \sqrt{{G_x}^2 + {G_y}^2}.\]

\noindent Additionally, the gradient direction of each pixel can be calculated from the derivative images by measuring the angle between the x-axis and the gradient pixel coordinates by employing the atan2 function:

\[G_\phi = \text{atan2}(G_y, G_x) \]

\noindent Using $G_\phi$, edge thinning via non-maximum suppression is applied to the gradient image as the third step in the algorithm: For each pixel, the gradient direction acts as a criterion to decide which two neighboring pixels, that are each on opposite sides (positive and negative direction of the gradient), should be compared to the current pixel. If the value of the current pixel is not larger than the two neighbors' values, the pixel's value is not a local maximum and is set to zero. The gradient direction angles can either be rounded so that each angle represents one of the north-south, west-east directions and so forth, or linear interpolation can be used.

In the final step, a hysteresis threshold is applied. This process consists of defining two thresholds, $\theta_{high}$ and $\theta_{low}$. The definition for the thresholding function as given in \ref{sec:thresholding} is slightly altered:

\[ T(I(x, y), \theta_{high}, \theta_{low}) =  \begin{cases}
							2 \text{ if } I(x, y) \, \geq \, \theta_{high} \\
							1 \text{ if } I(x, y) \, \geq \, \theta_{low} \text{ and } < \theta_{high} \\
			          				0 \text{ otherwise}
			   			        \end{cases}
\]

\noindent Pixels that have a value of $2$ are called strong pixels because they had values larger than the high threshold, whereas pixels with a value of $1$ are called weak pixels. Finally, the algorithm checks for each pixel if an 8-connected path between that pixel and a strong pixel exists - if not, then the pixel is dropped. This can be done with the help of connected component-finding algorithms by dropping each ``$1$''-component which is not connected to at least one ``2''-value.\\

\noindent The thresholds $\theta_{high}$ and $\theta_{low}$ have to be set by the user, although there exists the possibility to set these by using the Otsu threshold described in \ref{sec:thresholding} . Using this combination approach, $\theta_{high}$ is set to the Otsu threshold value for $I(x, y)$, and $\theta_{low}$ is set to $0.5 * \theta_{high}$.\cite{otsu_combine}


	\section{Gaussian Mixture Models}
Gaussian Mixtures Models (GMMs) are a subclass of mixture models, that is, probabilistic models which are combined with other models of the same distribution type to form a more complex model that is able to model the distribution of a data set more accurately than a simple model could. In the case of GMMs, the base distributions are often $n$-multivariate Gaussian distributions:

\[ pdf(x) = \mathcal{N}_n (x\,|\,\mu,\, \Sigma) \]

\noindent Here, $pdf(x)$ denotes the probability, or density, of an $n$-dimensional piece of data $x$, while $\mu$ and $\Sigma$ are the $n$-dimensional mean vector and the $n \times n$ covariance matrix of the distribution. Since the shape such a distribution can take is limited, a single Gaussian cannot accurately model a multimodal distribution (see Figure \ref{fig:normal_vs_gmm}). Instead, a weighted combination of multiple Gaussians can be used instead: \cite[pp. 430]{bishop_pattern}

\[ pdf_m (x) = \sum \limits_{k=1}^{K} \pi_k \, \mathcal{N}_n (x\,|\, \mu_k, \Sigma_k) \]

\noindent A mixture model consists of $K$ models that each have different parameters $\mu$ and $\Sigma$ and are weighted by weights $\pi_k \in \mathbb{R}$, $1 > \pi_k > 0$, with $\sum_{i=1}^{k} \pi_i = 1$.

\begin {figure}[!ht]
	\includegraphics{img/fig_normal_vs_gmm}
	\caption{Comparison of a single Gaussian fit (upper) with a GMM fit, using $K=3$, on a two-dimensional dataset randomly sampled from three Gaussian distributions. The single Gaussian fails to capture the structure of the data, while the GMM succeeds.}
	\label{fig:normal_vs_gmm}
\end {figure}

\noindent The parameters of such a mixture model can be calculated by applying the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, which can additionally be combined with a K-Means initialization to avoid shallow local minima.\cite{em_algorithm} GMMs can also be used for segmenting images: Grayscale images are simply three-dimensional data in which each pixel coordinate corresponds to an intensity value. If the number of components to be found in the image is known beforehand, as it is in the case of cell segmentation, the intensity values can be segmented according to the fitted GMM (see Figure \ref{fig:gmm_vs_gt}). To do this, for each pixel in the image the posterior probabilities for that pixel in respect to each of the Gaussians is calculated and the Gaussian with the highest probability is chosen as the ``source'' of the pixel:

\[ label_x = \argmax \limits_{k} \, p(\mu_k, \Sigma_k\, | \, x) \]

\begin {figure}[!ht]
	\includegraphics{img/fig_gmm_vs_gt}
	\caption{From left to right: Input image, pseudo-color labels assigned by a $K=4$ GMM fit to the input image and the ground truth labels for the input image.}

	\section{Graph Cuts}



	\section{Multi-layer Perceptrons}
\textit{Multi-layer Perceptrons} (MLPs) or \textit{Feedforward Artificial Neuronal Networks} (ANNs) are mathematical functions that try to emulate the way neurons in the brain process information, typically to classify data or perform regression on it. ANNs have recently achieved impressing results on various tasks, such as image classification, sound analysis and regression, typically achieved by very deep networks that used lots of artificial neurons and were fed large datasets exceeding one million samples. In this section, the concepts behind optimization of functions via Gradient Descent, neuronal networks and training of those networks using the Backpropagation algorithm are explained. 



	\subsection {Gradient Descent}
\label{subsec:grad_desc}

\textit{Gradient Descent} or is a standard, analytic first-order technique first introduced by that can be used to minimize or maximize at least once-differentiable, continuous functions, that is, to calculate a vector of parameters $\Theta$ for a function $f$ so that

\[ \Theta = \argmax \limits_{i} f(i) \]

\noindent To find values for $\Theta$, the approach takes advantage of the fact that the negative gradient vector $\nabla_f = [ \frac{\partial f}{\partial \Theta_0}, \dots, \frac{\partial f}{\partial \Theta_n} ]$, the vector of all first partial derivatives of $f$, points into the direction of the fastest change, or put graphically, the ``steepest slope''. By taking steps into the direction of this gradient, the function value is minimized step by step, while maximization works the same, only that the function is negated and then minimized, which results in parameters that maximize the original function. The parameter $\eta$ depicts the step size and is typically a value in the range $(0.0, 1.0]$. \cite[pp. 40--42]{optimization_book}

The algorithm starts with a guess for the parameters in $\Theta$ and then iteratively evaluates the gradient and updates the parameters accordingly until convergence within arbitrary precision is reached (see algorithm \ref{alg:grad_desc}).

\begin {algorithm}
	\begin {algorithmic}[1]
		\State $\Theta_0$ = random
		\While {$|f(\Theta_i) - f(\Theta_{i - 1})| > \epsilon$}
			\State $\Theta_i = \Theta_{i-1} - \eta \nabla_f$ 
		\EndWhile
	\end{algorithmic}
	\caption{Gradient Descent scheme for optimizing differentiable functions.}
	\label{alg:grad_desc}
\end{algorithm}

\noindent For convex functions, Gradient Descent always finds the global minimum. For non-convex functions however, the algorithm may get stuck in a local minimum or at saddle points, called ``false minima' (see figure \ref{fig:grad_desc}). Therefore, running the algorithm multiple times with random values or even informed guesses given knowledge about the form of the function to be optimized is advised. The step size $\eta$ has to be chosen depending on the shape of the function to minimize; if $\eta$ is too large, the algorithm will overshoot the minimum and never converges, even if the minimum exists, and if $\eta$ is too small, convergence will take a long time.

\begin {figure}[!ht]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.9]{img/fig_grad_desc}
	\end{center}
	\caption{\textbf{Left:} A contour plot of Gradient Descent minimization of $f(a, b) = \sin(a) + \cos^2(b)$. The blue line shows the search path of the algorithm along the negative gradient while estimating the optimal $\Theta$. \textbf{Right}: Effect of the initial guess for $\Theta$ on the optimization. The function $f(a) = \frac{1}{40}a^2 * \frac{1}{2} \cos(a)$ has multiple local minima in the interval [0, 25]. Only the third guess $a=25$ leads to finding the global minimum, while the other two optimization runs get trapped in local minima.}
	\label{fig:grad_desc}
\end {figure}

\noindent In a machine learning context, the function to optimize often has fixed parameters in addition to $\Theta$, such as data from a dataset that is related to the function is some way. In such cases, one can consider one of the subtypes of Gradient Descent; either, evaluating the average gradient using all available data samples (\textit{Batch Gradient Descent}) at once or using single data points only - as an approximation of the entire dataset - to perform the updates. This is called \textit{Stochastic Gradient Descent} (SGD) and is preferable if working with datasets that are too large to fit into memory. Alternatively, one can use the average gradient of a subset of data points - this method is often referred to as \textit{Mini-Batch} Gradient Descent. For example, considering the function

\[ f(\Theta) =  \theta_1 x_1 + \theta_2 x_2\]

\noindent with fixed $x_1$, $x_2$ from some dataset $X$. To minimize this function $f$ with respect to the variable parameters $\Theta$ using the dataset and SGD, the algorithm is modified to only take into consideration a single datapoint $x_i = [x_{i1}, x_{i2}]$ at a time chosen at random from $X$. Then, updating $\Theta$ is done by the formula

\[ \Theta_i = \Theta_{i-1} - \eta \nabla_{f_i} \]

\noindent where $f_i$ is the function $f$ evaluated for $x_i$ and $\Theta_{i-1}$. Similarily, to use Mini-Batch SGD with a batch size of $n$, an average over the gradients for $n$ datapoints is used:

\[ \Theta_i = \Theta_{i-1} - \eta \left ( \frac{1}{n} \sum \limits_{i=1}^{n} \nabla_{f_i} \right ) \]

\noindent The price that is paid for the relaxed memory cost of SGD is that the traversion towards the minimum becomes noisy for small $n$, as the algorithm approximates the gradient by using only a part of the dataset. For functions with minima in shallow ``valleys'', SGD starts moving in a wild zig-zag pattern near the optimum, further increasing the number of steps the algorithm takes until covergence. To address these problems, a number of optimizations were proposed.


	\subsubsection {Momentum}
\text{Momentum} is an optimization for the Gradient Descent that adds an additional factor to the update step which is dependent on the steepness of the traversed function in previous updates. Using the analogy of a marble rolling down a slope, momentum refers to the inertia of the marble that allows it to jump over saddle points or small holes (local minima) on the bowl's surface rather than stopping abruptly once such a location is reached. This changes the SGD update formula to

\begin {align}
	& v_i = \gamma v_ {i-1} + \eta \nabla_f\\ 
	& \Theta_i = \Theta_{i-1} - v_i
\end {align}

\noindent where $v$ is the momentum vector with one entry per gradient element and $\gamma$ is a modifier that changes the influence of the momentum on the update.

	\begin {figure}[!ht]
		\begin{center}
			\scalebox{0.75}{\input{img/fig_momentum.pgf}}
		\end{center}
		\caption[]{The effect of momentum on SGD, applied to fitting a line to a noisy two-dimensional dataset with $\eta = 0.1$. \textbf{Left:} Standard SGD. Near the optimum, the algorithm begins zig-zagging and takes many steps to converge. \textbf{Right:} Momentum with SGD and $\gamma = 0.85$. Although the algorithm overshoots the minimum a few times, the number of steps until convergence is much smaller.}
		\label{fig:momentum}
	\end {figure}


	\subsubsection {Learning Rate Decay}
Another optimization that is often used is \textit{Learning Rate decay}, also called \textit{Learning Rate Annealing}. It exchanges the fixed learning rate $\eta$ with a learning rate that is a function of the iteration number so that based on how long the optimization has been running, the step size becomes smaller. This has the benefit of being able to take large steps towards the minimum initially, but to allow the search to be narrowed down when near the minimum and avoid endless overshooting. The most popular of these is the step decay, which reduces the learning rate by some factor $\zeta$ every $x$ iterations. Let $i$ be a variable counting the number of iterations. The learning rate in an iteration is then given by

\[ \eta_i = \eta_{i-1} * {\zeta}^{\left \lfloor \frac{i}{x} \right \rfloor} \]

\noindent The SGD update then works as normal, only that after each iteration, $\eta$ is calculated anew given the above formula.




	\subsection{The Perceptron Algorithm}
\label{subsec:perceptron_algo}

A single-layer ANN is a network consisting of just one neuron, and is also called ``perceptron''. The idea for the perceptron was first proposed by Rosenblatt \cite{rosenblatt_report, rosenblatt_book}, who used it to perform binary classifications, using what is now called the ``perceptron algorithm''. Given a linearly separable set of $m$ data points of dimension $n$, one can construct a $(n+1) \times m$ input matrix $x$. The last entry in every column is set to $1$ to simplify the notation later on.

The \textit{perceptron classifier}, the function that decides which class a given sample belongs to, then takes the form of a linear function

\[ d(x) = h(w^{T}x), \label{eq:perc_class} \]

\noindent where $w$ is a vector of dimension $n+1$ and contains the $n$ \textit{weights} and the \textit{bias} value. The function $h$ is the \textit{activation function}, which is defined as 

\[ h(a) =  \begin{cases}
		+1 \text{ if } a \geq 0 \\
	   	 -1 \text{ otherwise}
	    \end{cases}\]

\noindent and maps its input to one of two possible classes.\\

\noindent The task of \textit{training} is defined as finding values for $w_0, \dots, w_{n+1}$ so that each data point is classified correctly by the resulting line, plane or (hyper-)plane. To this account, there needs to be a $m$-dimensional vector $t$ containing the \textit{labels} of each data point to verify the correctness of $w$. These labels are integers that indicate which class each data point belongs to. In the case of the perceptron algorithm, the labels are either $1$ for the first class $C_1$ or $-1$ for the second class, $C_2$. If all data points are classified correctly by some $w$, then it holds that

\[ w^T x_n \, t_n > 0 \,\,\forall\, x_n \in x \label{eq:perceptron_label} \]

\noindent Using this definition of correctness, a correctness measure can be formulated, which is known as the ``perceptron criterion''. Functions of this kind are also called \textit{error functions} or \textit{loss functions}. This particular loss function is given by

\[ E_p(w) = - \sum \limits_{n \in \mathcal{M}} w^T x_n\, t_n, \label{eq:perc_error}\]

\noindent where $\mathcal{M}$ is the set of all data points that were misclassfied, meaning that evaluating equation \ref{eq:perceptron_label} for that data yields a value $< 0$. \cite[pp. 192--194]{bishop_pattern}\\

\noindent The correct perceptron weights can then be determined by some arbitrary learning algorithm, although here, the Gradient Descent scheme (see algorithm \ref{alg:grad_desc}) is applied to the error function \ref{eq:perc_error}. Either (Batch) Gradient Descent or Stochastic Gradient Descent can be used.

Either way, the gradient of $E_p$ has to be calculated. The perceptron criterion only depends on the weights $w$, so the gradient vector has the shape

\[ \nabla_E = \left[ \frac{\partial E_p}{\partial w_0}, \frac{\partial E_p}{\partial w_1}, \dots, \frac{\partial E_p}{\partial w_{n+1}} \right ] \,. \]

\noindent Taking the partial derivatives in respect to $w$ leads to

\begin{align}
 	\nabla_E &= \frac{\partial E_p}{\partial w} = \frac{\partial}{\partial w} \left (- \sum \limits_{n \in \mathcal{M}} w^T x_n t_n \right ) \\
 	&= -\sum \limits_{n \in \mathcal{M}} x_n t_n
\end{align}

\noindent If SGD is used, this is reduced to simply

\[ \nabla_E = -x_n t_n\]

\noindent for some previously misclassified point $x_n \in \mathcal{M}$ in the dataset. Hence, the update rule for the perceptron becomes

\[w_i = w_{i - 1} + x_n t_n * \eta\]

\noindent Using this update rule leads to the training algorithm shown in \ref{alg:perceptron_algorithm}, which is applied to an example dataset in figure \ref{fig:perceptron}.

	\end{algorithmic}

\end{algorithm}



		\subsection{Multiple Neurons and Backpropagation}
\label{subsec:mlp_backprop}
While the perceptron algorithm works fine for linear problems, those are only a small subset of real-world problems (see figure \ref{fig:perceptron}). The solution to this problem is to add more neurons to the model, which form a network that consists of layers that pass the outputs of neurons in the previous layers through non-linear activation functions and then use the results as inputs. These layers are referred to as the ``input layer'', the initial layer, the ``output layer'', the last layer, and ``hidden layers'', which are all the layers inbetween.

The resulting networks are called \textit{Multi-Layer Perceptrons} (MLPs), \textit{Feedforward Artificial Neural Networks}(ANNs), or, in the case of a multitude of layers, \textit{Deep Neural Networks}, and are much more powerful than simple perceptrons, as they can approximate haphazard continuous functions that operate on closed and bounded subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$ given that the network possesses at least one hidden layer of neurons. This capability makes using MLPs for learning real-life problems feasible.\cite{universal_approx}\cite{universal_approx2}\\

\noindent Again, each neuron in the network computes a weighted sum of its $i$ inputs, just like in equation \ref{eq:perc_class}, although indexing has been added to identify neurons and weights in the entire network:

\[ a_j^{(l)} = \sum \limits_{i} w^{(l)}_{ji}\,\, y_i + b^{(l)}_{j} \]

\noindent $y_i$ are the input values to the current neuron. Note that these either are the direct inputs $x_i$ to the network, or outputs of other neurons, depending on where in the network the term is evaluated. $w$ is the matrix of weights, and $w^{(l)}_{ji}$ denotes the weight of the connection from the $i$th neuron in the previous layer $l - 1$ to the $j$th neuron in the  layer $l$. The term $b$ is the bias weight associated with the neuron $j$. The bias can be made part of the weight matrix by introducing an additional input dimension with a value of $1$, like it was done for the perceptron algorithm in section \ref{subsec:perceptron_algo}.

Afterwards, the sum $a^{(l)}_j$ is passed into an activation function $h(\cdot)$ to produce the activation of the $j$th neuron in the $l$th layer, $z_j^{(l)}$:

\[ z_j^{(l)} = h(a^{(l)}_j) \]

\noindent In vectorized notation, the activations of an entire layer could therefore be written as the recursive formula

\[ z^{(l)} = h(w^{(l)} z^{(l-1)}) \cite{nielsen_book} \]

\noindent where the activations of the input layer are simply the inputs themselves, thus ending the recursion. Expanding the term for the 2-layer network shown in figure \ref{fig:mlp} gives the following formula for a network output $out_k$:

\[ out_k = \sigma \left ( \sum \limits_{j=0}^{4} w^{(2)}_{kj}\,\, h \left ( \sum \limits_{i=0}^{3} w^{(1)}_{ji} x_i \right ) \right ) \label{eq:mlp_out} \]

\noindent Here, \textbf{$\sigma$} is an output function that is applied in the last layer of the network, and is dependent on the task the network is supposed to fulfill: For regression problems, fitting a function to a set of data and then predicting new values using that function, the identity function can be used, but for binary classification problems, instead of using a step function like in the original perceptron, one instead uses the continuous \textit{Sigmoid} function and interprets the output as

\[ \sigma_{sig}(x_i) = \begin{cases}
				x_i \in C_1 \text{ if } \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x_i}} \geq 0.5 \\
				x_i \in C_2 \text{ else }\\
			 \end{cases}
\]

\noindent Also, the choice of the activation function $h(w, x)$ is different from the perceptron: It is not chosen to be the Heaviside function, but instead, to be a non-linear, continuous and differentiable function. Computing an output is done by passing the input vector to the first layer, which computes its activations for all its neurons, which then pass on their activations to the neurons of the next layer as inputs until the output layer is reached.

If the classification is non-binary, using the \textit{Softmax} function (see section \ref{subsec:softmax}) to obtain probabilities for the likeliness of $x_i$ being part of any of the classes is a solution.\\

	\footnotetext{There is no consensus on which method of counting is the most appropriate. Sometimes, only the number of hidden layers or even all layers are counted \cite[pp. 229]{bishop_pattern}}
}

\noindent The goal of training an MLP is - as previously for the perceptron - finding specific weights so that all inputs are classified correctly, or at least, so that the network makes only few mistakes. Therefore, a loss layer is added to the end of the network, measuring the correctness of the output. Instead of the perceptron criterion \ref{eq:perc_error}, a more general loss function is employed which compares the difference between the output $\sigma(x)$ of the network for a sample $x$ and the preferred output for $x$, the \textit{label} or \textit{ground truth} of $x$. Typically, the loss function for regression problems is based on the \textit{Least Squares Error} (LSE), which is defined as

\[ LSE(w) = \frac{1}{2} \left ( out - t \right )^2, \]

\noindent where the single, linear output of the network for some input $x$ and a set of weights $w$ is compared to the ground truth $t$.\footnote{The error is only given as a function of $w$ because both the input $x$ and its correct label $t$ are fixed in the particular case presented here.} Binary classification problems instead use Sigmoid outputs together with the \textit{Cross-Entropy} loss function, which is defined as 

\[ CE(w) =  -t \, \ln out + (1 - t) \ln (1 - out). \]

\noindent For multi-class classifications, an adaption of the Cross-Entropy loss can be used, which is further described in section \ref{subsec:cross_ent}. \cite[pp. 232-236]{bishop_pattern}\\

\noindent Training a network with multiple layers is harder than training a single perceptron because the influence of each of the weights in any layer of the network on the error function has to be computed when using gradient-based optimization methods while the output of the network no longer is the result of a single function, but instead, a composition of an usually large number of functions (see equation \ref{eq:mlp_out}). Although it is possible to manually calculate the partial derivatives for the entire network, this becomes more and more cumbersome as the network grows in size.

Luckily, there exists an iterative algorithm called \textit{Backpropagation} \cite{backprop} that finds the gradient of the loss with respect to each weight so that an optimization method can be applied to change every weight. The algorithm makes use of the fact that each neuron can be viewed (almost) independently from the rest of the network. Remembering that the analytic way of obtaining the derivative of a composition of functions 

\[ f \circ g = f(g(x)) \]

\noindent with respect to some $x$ is to apply the chain rule

\[ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} =\frac{\partial f}{\partial g} \frac{\partial g}{\partial x} \, , \]

\noindent one can see that this concept can also be applied to neurons in a network, because using the output value of a neuron in a previous layer as the input for a node is nothing else than function composition.\\

\noindent Backpropagation thus starts with a \textit{forward pass}, which means that an input vector $x$ is passed through the network and the corresponding sums $a_j$ and activations $z_j$ are calculated and stored. Comparing the final outputs to the ground truth in the loss layer, the network is then traversed in the opposite direction in what is called a \textit{backward pass}, aiming to obtain the influence of each weight in each layer on the final loss, that is, the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights. After this first phase, the partial derivatives for each weight are known, and the weights are updated in a second phase, in which an optimization algorithm like Gradient Descent is used as described in section \ref{subsec:grad_desc}.\\

\noindent The central idea of the backward pass is that when traversing the network from the output layer to the input layer, the derivatives of the loss function with respect to weights of a layer depend on weights of the layers that precede them. This relationship is described by the formula

\begin {align}
	\frac{\partial E}{\partial w_{ji}} &= \frac{\partial E}{\partial a_j} \frac{\partial a_j}{\partial w_{ji}}
\end {align}

\noindent where $E$ is the loss function of the network. According to the chain rule, the influence of the weight $w_{ji}$ on the loss is equal to the influence of the weight on the sum of inputs $a_j$ times the influence of $a_j$ on the loss function. In literature, the term $\frac{\partial E}{\partial a_j}$ is often denoted as $\delta_j^{(l)}$, the ``error'' of the neuron $j$ in layer $l$. Using this notation and taking the partial derivative of the weighted sum $a_j$, the formula becomes

\[ \frac{\partial E}{\partial w_{ji}} = \delta_j^{(l)} z_i .\]

\noindent Since $z_i$, the activation from the input end of the connection that is modified by $w_{ji}$, is already known for all neurons due to the forward pass, the only thing that needs to be computed to figure out the loss gradient are the $\delta$-values. The computation of $\delta_j^{(l)}$ depends on the position of the neuron in the network:

\[ \delta_j^{(l)} =  \begin{cases}
				\frac{\partial E}{\partial a_j} \text{ if neuron } j^{(l)} \text{ is an output neuron} \\
			           h'(a_j) \sum \limits_{k} w_{kj} \, \delta_k^{(l+1)} \text{ otherwise}
			     \end{cases}
\]

\noindent In the case $j$ is an output neuron, the partial is calculated directly. Otherwise, $\delta_j$ depends on the $\delta$-values in the previous layers, necessitating the backward traversion (see figure \ref{fig:backprop}). The definition of $\delta$ for hidden neurons is also the reason why a differentiable function must be chosen as the activation $h(\cdot)$, as stated earlier.\\

\noindent The main advantage of the algorithm is that it scales linearly with the number of weights, i.e. the algorithm is $\in \mathcal{O}(w)$. Furthermore, the fact that all $\delta$-values of a layer have to be calculated to calculate all $\delta$ values and weight derivatives in the layer that precedes it naturally leads to vectorizing the algorithm layerwise in efficient implementations. \cite{nielsen_book}\cite{ng_lecture}\cite[pp. 241-245]{bishop_pattern}

The central neuron is the only neuron in the layer $l$, while there are two neurons each in the layers $l-1$ and $l+1$. These other layers could be other hidden layers, input layers, or output layers, as the computation is generalized by the definition of $\delta$. The forward pass calculates the weighted sum $a_1^{(l)}$ and the activation $h(a_1^{(l)})$. Once the backward pass reaches the neuron, it calculates $\delta_1^{(l)}$ and the partial derivatives of the weights of layer $l$, that is, the weights of the connections that flow into the central neuron in the forward pass, using the backpropagated value $\delta_k^{(l+1)}$. This is repeated throughout the entire network until the entire weight gradient is known and a single Gradient Descent step can be taken toward the loss function minimum.}

\noindent Depending on how deep the networks are, i.e. how many hidden layers there are and how many neurons there are in these hidden layers, neural networks can learn very complex classification boundaries. The role of the activation function is akin to the kernel principle of State Vector Machines (SVMs), since it maps inputs to a representation in which they are linearly separable by a hyperplane (see figure \ref{fig:mlp_trick}).

\noindent Choosing the number of hidden layers and the number of hidden neurons within them wisely is important because bad choices can make the network susceptible to underfitting or overfitting.

\textit{Underfitting} is the term for the inability of a method to model the data correctly. For example, a linear classifier always underfits on a not-linearly separable dataset because it is not powerful enough to solve the problem. \textit{Overfitting} is the exact opposite and occurs when the model is too complex so that it doesn't model a trend in the data, but instead memorizes the dataset (see figure \ref{fig:overfit}). This is undesirable because such a model cannot generalize well and will make incorrect classifications once it is asked to classify data it hasn't been presented with during training. Therefore, a balance has to be found to equip a model with both enough power to classify correctly while also allowing leeway for generalizing when making predictions on new data.

		\label{fig:overfit}
	\end {figure}

\noindent The danger of overfitting on data increases with the complexity of the model. As MLPs are highly complex, often using millions of weights, overfitting is often a problem. Approaches that try to reduce overfitting in learning algorithms are called \textit{regularization} approaches.




	\subsection{Training Optimizations and Regularization}

	\subsubsection {Dropout}
\label{subsec:dropout}
\textit{Dropout} is a regularization technique \cite{dropout} that ``disables'' neurons it is applied to during training with a certain chance according to a user-defined Bernoulli probability. These disabled neurons are not trained on the particular training sample - an effect one could view as training only a sub-network of the original neural network. By applying Dropout repeatedly and scaling the weights by the Dropout probability $p$ during testing, one gains an approximation of averaging the outputs of all possible $2^n$ sub-networks, where $n$ is the number of neurons in the network. This lowers the amount of overfitting because neurons learn not to ``rely'' on other neurons which otherwise would lead to specialized co-adaptions that usually hurt the generalization ability of the network.



	\subsubsection {Batch Normalization}
\label{subsec:batchnorm}
\textit{Batch Normalization} (BN) \cite{batchnorm} is a method to improve training accuracy and speed while training either general MLPs or CNNs with the SGD algorithm (or other gradient-based algorithms that use mini-batches). The idea a BN layer in a network is based on is that Backpropagation works better if the inputs to the network are normalized (see also section \ref{sec:preprocessing}). However, as the input passes through the network, the repeated transformations change the distribution of the data, referred to by the authors of the BN paper as ``internal covariance shift''. Batch Normalization reduces this shift by re-normalizing data within the network so that the following layers once again work on normalized data. For this purpose, such a layer first normalizes the data by applying the formula 

\[  \hat{x} = \frac{x - E[x]}{\sqrt{Var[x]} + \epsilon} \]

\noindent where $E$ is the mean of an SGD mini-batch, $Var$ is the covariance and $\epsilon$ is an added constant that provides numerical stability. These calculations are done for each dimension of the input separately. Additionally, it has two variables $\gamma$ and $\beta$ which are learned by Backpropagation. These variables perform an affine transformation of the normalized data given by

\[ y_i = \gamma \hat{x} + \beta \]

\noindent This transformation simply provides a means to scale and shift the normalized data. In case the best operation is to not transform the data at all, the parameters can be learned to be set to 

\[ \gamma = \sqrt{Var[x]} \,\,\text{ and } \,\, \beta = E[x] ,\]

\noindent in which case the affine transformation simply recovers the original, un-normalized input to the BN layer.

\textbf{TODO:} test time and CNN special case?
