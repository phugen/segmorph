\chapter*{Abstract}

\noindent This thesis presents the application of a Convolutional Neural Network architecture, namely the \textit{U-Net} network, to a multi-class image segmentation problem on fluorescence microscopy data and also explores different optimization methods for preprocessing the data and training the network, while surpassing traditional non-neural network based methods, achieving a Macro F-Measure result of $\approx$0.765 on a 4-class dataset and a score of $\approx$0.86 when reducing the same dataset to 3 classes, which is about 20\% better than the best alternative method tested.\\
